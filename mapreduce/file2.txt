“Y
ou have not, of course, passed your Apparition
T
est,” he said.
“No,” said Harry
. “I thought you had to be seventeen?”
“Y
ou do,” said Dumbledore. “So you will need to hold
on to my arm very tightly
. My left, if you don’
t mind —
as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at
the moment.”
Harry gripped Dumbledore’
s prof
fered forearm.
“V
ery good,” said Dumbledore. “W
ell, here we go.”
Harry felt Dumbledore’
s arm twist away from him and
redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew
, everything
went black; he was being pressed very hard from all
directions; he could not breathe, there were iron
bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were
being forced back into his head; his eardrums were
being pushed deeper into his skull and then —
He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened
his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just
been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a
few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had
www.ztcprep.com

vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in
P a g e 
| 64
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center of which stood
an old war memorial and a few
benches. His comprehension catching up with his
senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for
the first time in his life.
“Are you all right?” asked Dumbledore, looking down
at him solicitously
. “The sensation does take some
getting used to.”
“I’m fine,” said Harry
, rubbing his ears, which felt as
though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly
.
“But I think I might prefer brooms. …”
Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little
more tightly around his neck, and said, “This way
.”
He set of
f at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a
few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church,
it was almost midnight.
“So tell me, Harry
,” said Dumbledore. “Y
our scar …
has it been hurting at all?”
www.ztcprep.com

Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead
and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark.
“No,” he said, “and I’ve been wondering about that. I
thought it would be burning all the time now
V
oldemort’
s getting so powerful again.”
He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was
wearing a satisfied expression.
“I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,” said
Dumbledore. “Lord V
oldemort has finally realized the
dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you
have been enjoying. It appears that he is now
employing Occlumency against you.”
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“W
ell, I’m not complaining,” said Harry
, who missed neither the disturbing
dreams nor the startling
flashes of insight into V
oldemort’
s mind.
They turned a corner
, passing a telephone box and a
bus shelter
. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore
again. “Professor?”
“Harry?”
www.ztcprep.com

“Er — where exactly are we?”
“This, Harry
, is the charming village of Budleigh
Babberton.”
“And what are we doing here?”
“Ah yes, of course, I haven’
t told you,” said
Dumbledore. “W
ell, I have lost count of the number of
times I have said this in recent years, but we are,
once again, one member of staf
f short. W
e are here to
persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of
retirement and return to Hogwarts.”
“How can I help with that, sir?”
“Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you,” said Dumbledore
vaguely
. “Left here, Harry
.”
They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with
houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that
had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here
too. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over his
shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his
pocket.
“Professor
, why couldn’
t we just Apparate directly into
www.ztcprep.com

your old colleague’
s house?”
P a g e 
| 66
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down
the front door
,” said Dumbledore. “Courtesy dictates
that we of
fer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying
us entry
. In any case, most W
izarding dwellings are
magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At
Hogwarts, for instance —”
“— you can’
t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings
or grounds,” said Harry quickly
. “Hermione Granger
told me.”
“And she is quite right. W
e turn left again.”
The church clock chimed midnight behind them.
Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it
rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that
conversation had been established, he had more
pressing questions to ask.
“Sir
, I saw in the 
Daily Pr
ophet
 that Fudge has been
sacked. …”
www.ztcprep.com

“Correct,” said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep
side street. “He has been replaced, as I am sure you
also saw
, by Rufus Scrimgeour
, who used to be Head
of the Auror of
fice.”
“Is he … Do you think he’
s good?” asked Harry
.
“An interesting question,” said Dumbledore. “He is
able, certainly
. A more decisive and forceful
personality than Cornelius.”
“Y
es, but I meant —”
“I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action
and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his
working life, does not underestimate Lord V
oldemort.”
P a g e 
| 67
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything
about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the
Daily Pr
ophet
 had reported, and he did not have the
nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed it. “And …
sir … I saw about Madam Bones.”
“Y
es,” said Dumbledore quietly
. “A terrible loss. She
www.ztcprep.com

was a great witch. Just up here, I think — ouch.”
He had pointed with his injured hand.
“Professor
, what happened to your — ?”
“I have no time to explain now
,” said Dumbledore. “It
is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.”
He smiled at Harry
, who understood that he was not
being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep
asking questions.
“Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about
security measures we should all take against the
Death Eaters. …”
“Y
es, I received one myself,” said Dumbledore, still
smiling. “Did you find it useful?”
“Not really
.”
“No, I thought not. Y
ou have not asked me, for
instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check
that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an
impostor
.”
“I didn’
t …” Harry began, not entirely sure whether he
was being reprimanded or not.
www.ztcprep.com

“For future reference, Harry
, it is raspberry …
although of course, if I were a Death Eater
, I would
P a g e 
| 68
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
have been sure to research my own jam preferences
before impersonating myself.”
“Er … right,” said Harry
. “W
ell, on that leaflet, it said
something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The
leaflet wasn’
t very clear
.”
“They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly
. “Dead
bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark
wizard’
s bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long
time, however
, not since V
oldemort was last powerful.
… He killed enough people to make an army of them,
of course. This is the place, Harry
, just here. …”
They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its
own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible
idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything
else, but as they reached the front gate, Dumbledore
stopped dead and Harry walked into him.
www.ztcprep.com

“Oh dear
. Oh dear
, dear
, dear
.”
Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front
path and felt his heart sink. The front door was
hanging of
f its hinges.
Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It
seemed quite deserted.
“W
and out and follow me, Harry
,” he said quietly
.
He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up
the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the
front door very slowly
, his wand raised and at the
ready

“
Lumos. 
”
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
Dumbledore’
s wand tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway
. T
o the
left, another door stood open.
Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore
walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind
him.
A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A
grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face
www.ztcprep.com

cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a
dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys
strewn across the floor
. The wreckage of a fallen
chandelier glittered nearby
. Cushions lay deflated,
feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments
of glass and china lay like powder over everything.
Dumbledore raised his wand even higher
, so that its
light was thrown upon the walls, where something
darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the
wallpaper
. Harry’
s small intake of breath made
Dumbledore look around.
“Not pretty
, is it?” he said heavily
. “Y
es, something
horrible has happened here.”
Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the
room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry
followed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might
see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the
overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body
.
“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him
of
f, Professor?” Harry suggested, trying not to imagine
www.ztcprep.com

how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave
those stains spattered halfway up the walls.
“I don’
t think so,” said Dumbledore quietly
, peering
behind an overstuf
fed armchair lying on its side.
“Y
ou mean he’
s — ?”
P a g e 
| 70
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Still here somewhere? Y
es.”
And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging
the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuf
fed
armchair
, which yelled, “Ouch!”
“Good evening, Horace,” said Dumbledore,
straightening up again.
Harry’
s jaw dropped. Where a split second before
there had been an armchair
, there now crouched an
enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his
lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an
aggrieved and watery eye.
“There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,”
he said gruf
fly
, clambering to his feet. “It hurt.”
www.ztcprep.com

The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his
prominent eyes, his enormous, silver
, walruslike
mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the
maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of
lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached
Dumbledore’
s chin.
“What gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to
his feet, still rubbing his lower belly
. He seemed
remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been
discovered pretending to be an armchair
.
“My dear Horace,” said Dumbledore, looking amused,
“if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark
Mark would have been set over the house.”
The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast
forehead.
“The Dark Mark,” he muttered. “Knew there was
something … ah well. W
ouldn’
t have had time
P a g e

anyway
, I’d only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you
entered the room.”
www.ztcprep.com

He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his
mustache flutter
.
“W
ould you like my assistance clearing up?” asked
Dumbledore politely
.
“Please,” said the other
.
They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the
short round one, and waved their wands in one
identical sweeping motion.
The furniture flew back to its original places;
ornaments reformed in midair
, feathers zoomed into
their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as
they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared
onto side tables and reignited; a vast collection of
splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across
the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon
a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere,
and the walls wiped themselves clean.
“What kind of blood was that, incidentally?” asked
Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly
unsmashed grandfather clock.
www.ztcprep.com

“On the walls? Dragon,” shouted the wizard called
Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling,
the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.
There was a final 
plunk
 from the piano, and silence.
“Y
es, dragon,” repeated the wizard conversationally
.
“My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the
moment. Still, it might be reusable.”
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and
held it up to the light,
examining the thick liquid within.
“Hmm. Bit dusty
.”
He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It
was then that his gaze fell upon Harry
.
“Oho,” he said, his lar
ge round eyes flying to Harry’
s
forehead and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. “
Oho
!”
“This,” said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the
introduction, “is Harry Potter
. Harry
, this is an old
friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.”
Slughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression
www.ztcprep.com

shrewd. “So that’
s how you thought you’d persuade
me, is it? W
ell, the answer
’
s no, Albus.”
He pushed past Harry
, his face turned resolutely
away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.
“I suppose we can have a drink, at least?” asked
Dumbledore. “For old time’
s sake?”
Slughorn hesitated.
“All right then, one drink,” he said ungraciously
.
Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward
a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so
recently impersonated, which stood right beside the
newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp.
Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that
Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as
visible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had
been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face
the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry
.
P a g e 
| 73
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Hmpf,” he said, looking away quickly as though
www.ztcprep.com

frightened of hurting his eyes. “Here —” He gave a
drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without
invitation, thrust the tray at Harry
, and then sank
into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a
disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did
not touch the floor
.
“W
ell, how have you been keeping, Horace?”
Dumbledore asked.
“Not so well,” said Slughorn at once. “W
eak chest.
Wheezy
. Rheumatism too. Can’
t move like I used to.
W
ell, that’
s to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.”
“And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to
prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,”
said Dumbledore. “Y
ou can’
t have had more than
three minutes’ warning?”
Slughorn said, half irritably
, half proudly
, “T
wo.
Didn’
t hear my Intruder Charm go of
f, I was taking a
bath. Still,” he added sternly
, seeming to pull himself
back together again, “the fact remains that I’m an old
man, Albus. A tired old man who’
s earned the right to
www.ztcprep.com

a quiet life and a few creature comforts.”
He certainly had those, thought Harry
, looking
around the room. It was stuf
fy and cluttered, yet
nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were
soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of
chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not
known who lived there, he would have guessed at a
rich, fussy old lady
.
“Y
ou’re not yet as old as I am, Horace,” said
Dumbledore.
P a g e 
| 74
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“W
ell, maybe you ought to think about retirement
yourself,” said Slughorn bluntly
. His pale gooseberry
eyes had found Dumbledore’
s injured hand.
“Reactions not what they were, I see.”
“Y
ou’re quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely
,
shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those
burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made
the back of Harry’
s neck prickle unpleasantly
. “I am
www.ztcprep.com

undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other
hand …”
He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to
say that age had its compensations, and Harry
noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had
never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was lar
ge,
rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and
was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked
down the middle. Slughorn’
s eyes lingered for a
moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown
momentarily crease his wide forehead.
“So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace
… are they for the Death Eaters’ benefit, or mine?”
asked Dumbledore.
“What would the Death Eaters want with a poor
broken-down old buf
fer like me?” demanded
Slughorn.
“I imagine that they would want you to turn your
considerable talents to coercion, torture, and
murder
,” said Dumbledore. “Are you really telling me
www.ztcprep.com

that they haven’
t come recruiting yet?”
Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment,
then muttered, “I haven’
t given them the chance. I’ve
been on the move for a year
. Never stay in one place
more than a week. Move from Muggle house to

| 75
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
Muggle house — the owners of this place are on
holiday in the Canary Islands — it’
s been very
pleasant, I’ll be sorry to leave. It’
s quite easy once you
know how
, one simple Freezing Charm on these
absurd bur
glar alarms they use instead of
Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors don’
t
spot you bringing in the piano.”
“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “But it sounds a rather
tiring existence for a broken-down old buf
fer in
search of a quiet life. Now
, if you were to return to
Hogwarts —”
“If you’re going to tell me my life would be more
peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your
www.ztcprep.com

breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some
funny rumors have reached me since Dolores
Umbridge left! If that’
s how you treat teachers these
days —”
“Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,”
said Dumbledore. “I think you, Horace, would have
known better than to stride into the forest and call a
horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-breeds.’ ”
“That’
s what she did, did she?” said Slughorn. “Idiotic
woman. Never liked her
.”
Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn
looked round at him.
“Sorry
,” Harry said hastily
. “It’
s just — I didn’
t like
her either
.”
Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly
.
“Are you leaving?” asked Slughorn at once, looking
hopeful.
P a g e 
| 76
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“No, I was wondering whether I might use your
www.ztcprep.com

bathroom,” said Dumbledore.
“Oh,” said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. “Second on
the left down the hall.”
Dumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had
closed behind him, there was silence. After a few
moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed
uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive
look at Harry
, then crossed to the fire and turned his
back on it, warming his wide behind.
“Don’
t think I don’
t know why he’
s brought you,” he
said abruptly
.
Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn’
s watery
eyes slid over Harry’
s scar
, this time taking in the rest
of his face.
“Y
ou look very like your father
.”
“Y
eah, I’ve been told,” said Harry
.
“Except for your eyes. Y
ou’ve got —”
“My mother
’
s eyes, yeah.” Harry had heard it so often
he found it a bit wearing.
“Hmpf. Y
es, well. Y
ou shouldn’
t have favorites as a
www.ztcprep.com

teacher
, of course, but she was one of mine. Y
our
mother
,” Slughorn added, in answer to Harry’
s
questioning look. “Lily Evans. One of the brightest I
ever taught. V
ivacious, you know
. Charming girl. I
used to tell her she ought to have been in my House.
V
ery cheeky answers I used to get back too.”
“Which was your House?”
P a g e 
| 77
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now
,”
he went on quickly
, seeing the expression on Harry’
s
face and wagging a stubby finger at him, “don’
t go
holding that against me! Y
ou’ll be Gryf
findor like her
,
I suppose? Y
es, it usually goes in families. Not
always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? Y
ou must
have done — been in the papers for the last couple of
years — died a few weeks ago —”
It was as though an invisible hand had twisted
Harry’
s intestines and held them tight.
“W
ell, anyway
, he was a big pal of your father
’
s at
www.ztcprep.com

school. The whole Black family had been in my
House, but Sirius ended up in Gryf
findor! Shame —
he was a talented boy
. I got his brother
, Regulus,
when he came along, but I’d have liked the set.”
He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had
been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories,
he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot
to ensure an even heat on his backside.
“Y
our mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn’
t
believe it when I found out. Thought she must have
been pure-blood, she was so good.”
“One of my best friends is Muggle-born,” said Harry
,
“and she’
s the best in our year
.”
“Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’
t it?” said
Slughorn.
“Not really
,” said Harry coldly
.
Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. “Y
ou
mustn’
t think I’m prejudiced!” he said. “No, no, no!
Haven’
t I just said your mother was one of my all-time
favorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in
www.ztcprep.com

P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
the year after her too — now Head of the Goblin
Liaison Of
fice, of course — another Muggle-born, a
very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside
information on the goings-on at Gringotts!”
He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-
satisfied way
, and pointed at the many glittering
photograph frames on the dresser
, each peopled with
tiny moving occupants.
“All ex-students, all signed. Y
ou’ll notice Barnabas
Cuf
fe, editor of the 
Daily Pr
ophet, 
he’
s always
interested to hear my take on the day’
s news. And
Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes — a hamper every
birthday
, and all because I was able to give him an
introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his
first job! And at the back — you’ll see her if you just
crane your neck — that’
s Gwenog Jones, who of
course captains the Holyhead Harpies. … People are
always astonished to hear I’m on first-name terms
www.ztcprep.com

with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want
them!”
This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously
.
“And all these people know where to find you, to send
you stuf
f?” asked Harry
, who could not help
wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked
down Slughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch
tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions
could find him.
The smile slid from Slughorn’
s face as quickly as the
blood from his walls.
“Of course not,” he said, looking down at Harry
. “I
have been out of touch with everybody for a year
.”
P a g e 
| 79
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
Harry had the impression that the words shocked
Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a
moment. Then he shrugged.
“Still … the prudent wizard keeps his head down in
such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but
www.ztcprep.com

taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be
tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the
Order of the Phoenix! And while I’m sure they’re very
admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’
t
personally fancy the mortality rate —”
“Y
ou don’
t have to join the Order to teach at
Hogwarts,” said Harry
, who could not quite keep a
note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to
sympathize with Slughorn’
s cosseted existence when
he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living
on rats. “Most of the teachers aren’
t in it, and none of
them has ever been killed — well, unless you count
Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he
was working with V
oldemort.”
Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those
wizards who could not bear to hear V
oldemort’
s name
spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn
gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry
ignored.
“I reckon the staf

Dumbledore’
s headmaster; he’
s supposed to be the
only one V
oldemort ever feared, isn’
t he?” Harry went
on.
Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He
seemed to be thinking over Harry’
s words.
“W
ell, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,” he
muttered grudgingly
. “And I suppose one could ar
gue

that as I have not joined the Death Eaters, He-Who-
Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend …
in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to
Albus. … I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones’
s death
did not shake me. … If she, with all her Ministry
contacts and protection …”
Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn
jumped as though he had for
gotten he was in the
house.
“Oh, there you are, Albus,” he said. “Y
ou’ve been a

very long time. Upset stomach?”
“No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,”
said Dumbledore. “I do love knitting patterns. W
ell,
Harry
, we have trespassed upon Horace’
s hospitality
quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.”
Not at all reluctant to obey
, Harry jumped to his feet.
Slughorn seemed taken aback.
“Y
ou’re leaving?”
“Y
es, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see
one.”
“Lost… ?”
Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat
thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore
fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket.
“W
ell, I’m sorry you don’
t want the job, Horace,” said
Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell
salute. “Hogwarts would have been glad to see you
back again. Our greatly increased security
notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit,
should you wish to.”

“Y
es … well … very gracious … as I say …”
“Good-bye, then.”
“Bye,” said Harry
.
They were at the front door when there was a shout
from behind them.
“All right, all right, I’ll do it!”
Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing
breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.
“Y
ou will come out of retirement?”
“Y
es, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently
. “I must be mad,
but yes.”
“W
onderful,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Then,
Horace, we shall see you on the first of September
.”
“Y
es, I daresay you will,” grunted Slughorn.
As they set of
f down the garden path, Slughorn’
s voice
floated after them, “I’ll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!”
Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut
behind them, and they set of
f back down the hill
www.ztcprep.com

through the dark and the swirling mist.
“W
ell done, Harry
,” said Dumbledore.
“I didn’
t do anything,” said Harry in surprise.
“Oh yes you did. Y
ou showed Horace exactly how
much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did
you like him?”
P a g e 
| 82
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Er …”
Harry wasn’
t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not.
He supposed he had been pleasant in his way
, but he
had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the
contrary
, much too surprised that a Muggle-born
should make a good witch.
“Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the
responsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort. He
also likes the company of the famous, the successful,
and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he
influences these people. He has never wanted to
occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat —
www.ztcprep.com

more room to spread out, you see. He used to
handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their
ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm
or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for
choosing those who would go on to become
outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a
kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center
,
making introductions, for
ging useful contacts
between members, and always reaping some kind of
benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite
crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the
next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Of
fice.”
Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great
swollen spider
, spinning a web around it, twitching a
thread here and there to bring its lar
ge and juicy flies
a little closer
.
“I tell you all this,” Dumbledore continued, “not to
turn you against Horace — or
, as we must now call
him, Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your
guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry
.

Y
ou would be the jewel of his collection; ‘the Boy Who
Lived’ … or
, as they call you these days, ‘the Chosen
One.’ ”
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist
stole over Harry
. He was reminded
of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that
had a horrible and particular meaning to him: 
Neither
can live while the other survives
 …
Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the
church they had passed earlier
.
“This will do, Harry
. If you will grasp my arm.”
Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition,
but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure
disappeared and he found himself able to breathe
again, he was standing in a country lane beside
Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked
silhouette of his second favorite building in the world:
the Burrow
. In spite of the feeling of dread that had
just swept through him, his spirits could not help but
www.ztcprep.com

lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there … and so was
Mrs. W
easley
, who could cook better than anyone he
knew
. …
“If you don’
t mind, Harry
,” said Dumbledore, as they
passed through the gate, “I’d like a few words with
you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?”
Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone
outhouse where the W
easleys kept their broomsticks.
A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through
the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the
average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of
his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled
down at Harry
.
“I hope you will for
give me for mentioning it, Harry
,
but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you
seem to be coping after everything that happened at
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
the Ministry
. Permit me to say that I think Sirius
would have been proud of you.”
www.ztcprep.com

Harry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted
him. He did not think he could stand to discuss
Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle
V
ernon say “His godfather
’
s dead?” and even worse to
hear Sirius’
s name thrown out casually by Slughorn.
“It was cruel,” said Dumbledore softly
, “that you and
Sirius had such a short time together
. A brutal
ending to what should have been a long and happy
relationship.”
Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider
now climbing Dumbledore’
s hat. He could tell that
Dumbledore understood, that he might even suspect
that until his letter arrived, Harry had spent nearly all
his time at the Dursleys’ lying on his bed, refusing
meals, and staring at the misted window
, full of the
chill emptiness that he had come to associate with
dementors.
“It’
s just hard,” Harry said finally
, in a low voice, “to
realize he won’
t write to me again.”
His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt
www.ztcprep.com

stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had
someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened
to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best
things about discovering his godfather … and now the
post owls would never bring him that comfort again.
…
“Sirius represented much to you that you had never
known before,” said Dumbledore gently
. “Naturally
,
the loss is devastating. …”
P a g e 
| 85
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“But while I was at the Dursleys’ …” interrupted
Harry
, his voice growing stronger
, “I realized I can’
t
shut myself away or — or crack up. Sirius wouldn’
t
have wanted that, would he? And anyway
, life’
s too
short. … Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline
V
ance. … It could be me next, couldn’
t it? But if it is,”
he said fiercely
, now looking straight into
Dumbledore’
s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight,
“I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me
www.ztcprep.com

as I can, and V
oldemort too if I can manage it.”
“Spoken both like your mother and father
’
s son and
Sirius’
s true godson!” said Dumbledore, with an
approving pat on Harry’
s back. “I take my hat of
f to
you — or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you
in spiders.
“And now
, Harry
, on a closely related subject … I
gather that you have been taking the 
Daily Pr
ophet
over the last two weeks?”
“Y
es,” said Harry
, and his heart beat a little faster
.
“Then you will have seen that there have been not so
much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in
the Hall of Prophecy?”
“Y
es,” said Harry again. “And now everyone knows
that I’m the one —”
“No, they do not,” interrupted Dumbledore. “There are
only two people in the whole world who know the full
contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord
V
oldemort, and they are both standing in this smelly
,
spidery broom shed. It is true, however
, that many
www.ztcprep.com

have guessed, correctly
, that V
oldemort sent his
Death Eaters to steal a prophecy
, and that the
prophecy concerned you.
P a g e 
| 86
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Now
, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that
you know what the prophecy said?”
“No,” said Harry
.
“A wise decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore.
“Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your
friends, Mr
. Ronald W
easley and Miss Hermione
Granger
. Y
es,” he continued, when Harry looked
startled, “I think they ought to know
. Y
ou do them a
disservice by not confiding something this important
to them.”
“I didn’
t want —”
“— to worry or frighten them?” said Dumbledore,
surveying Harry over the top of his half-moon
spectacles. “Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself
are worried and frightened? Y
ou need your friends,
Harry
. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have
www.ztcprep.com

wanted you to shut yourself away
.”
Harry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to
require an answer
. He continued, “On a dif
ferent,
though related, subject, it is my wish that you take
private lessons with me this year
.”
“Private — with you?” said Harry
, surprised out of his
preoccupied silence.
“Y
es. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in
your education.”
“What will you be teaching me, sir?”
“Oh, a little of this, a little of that,” said Dumbledore
airily
.
P a g e 
| 87
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
Harry waited hopefully
, but Dumbledore did not
elaborate, so he asked something else that had been
bothering him slightly
.
“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’
t have to do
Occlumency lessons with Snape, will I?”
“
Pr
ofessor
 Snape, Harry — and no, you will not.”
www.ztcprep.com

“Good,” said Harry in relief, “because they were a —”
He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.
“I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,”
said Dumbledore, nodding.
Harry laughed.
“W
ell, that means I won’
t see much of Professor
Snape from now on,” he said, “because he won’
t let
me carry on Potions unless I get ‘Outstanding’ in my
O.W
.L., which I know I haven’
t.”
“Don’
t count your owls before they are delivered,” said
Dumbledore gravely
. “Which, now I think of it, ought
to be some time later today
. Now
, two more things,
Harry
, before we part.
“Firstly
, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with
you at all times from this moment onward. Even
within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand
me?”
Harry nodded.
“And lastly
, while you stay here, the Burrow has been
given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can
www.ztcprep.com

provide. These measures have caused a certain
amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly — all

their post, for instance, is being searched at the
Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in
the slightest, for their only concern is your safety
.
However
, it would be poor repayment if you risked
your neck while staying with them.”
“I understand,” said Harry quickly
.
“V
ery well, then,” said Dumbledore, pushing open the
broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. “I
see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly
any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.”

AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of
the Burrow
, which was surrounded by the familiar
litter of old W
ellington boots and rusty cauldrons;
Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens
coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked
three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind
the kitchen window
.
“Who’
s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as
Mrs. W
easley’
s. “Declare yourself!”
“It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry
.”
The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. W
easley
,
short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing
gown.
“Harry
, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright,
you said not to expect you before morning!”
www.ztcprep.com

“W
e were lucky
,” said Dumbledore, ushering Harry
over the threshold. “Slughorn proved much more
P a g e 
| 90
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
persuadable than I had expected. Harry’
s doing, of
course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!”
Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. W
easley was
not alone, despite the lateness of the hour
. A young
witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy
brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a lar
ge
mug between her hands.
“Hello, Professor
,” she said. “W
otcher
, Harry
.”
“Hi, T
onks.”
Harry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there
was something forced in her smile. Certainly her
appearance was less colorful than usual without her
customary shade of bubble-gum-pink hair
.
“I’d better be of
f,” she said quickly
, standing up and
pulling her cloak around her shoulders. “Thanks for
the tea and sympathy
, Molly
.”
www.ztcprep.com

“Please don’
t leave on my account,” said Dumbledore
courteously
, “I cannot stay
, I have ur
gent matters to
discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour
.”
“No, no, I need to get going,” said T
onks, not meeting
Dumbledore’
s eyes. “ ’Night —”
“Dear
, why not come to dinner at the weekend,
Remus and Mad-Eye are coming — ?”
“No, really
, Molly … thanks anyway … Good night,
everyone.”
T
onks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the
yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on
the spot and vanished into thin air
. Harry noticed
that Mrs. W
easley looked troubled.
P a g e 
| 91
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“W
ell, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry
,” said
Dumbledore. “T
ake care of yourself. Molly
, your
servant.”
He made Mrs. W
easley a bow and followed T
onks,
vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. W
easley
www.ztcprep.com

closed the door on the empty yard and then steered
Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the
lantern on the table to examine his appearance.
“Y
ou’re like Ron,” she sighed, looking him up and
down. “Both of you look as though you’ve had
Stretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron’
s grown
four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are
you hungry
, Harry?”
“Y
eah, I am,” said Harry
, suddenly realizing just how
hungry he was.
“Sit down, dear
, I’ll knock something up.”
www.ztcprep.com

As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed
face jumped onto his knees and settled there,
purring.
“So Hermione’
s here?” he asked happily as he tickled
Crookshanks behind the ears.
“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday
,” said
Mrs. W
easley
, rapping a lar
ge iron pot with her wand.
It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began
to bubble at once. “Everyone’
s in bed, of course, we
didn’
t expect you for hours. Here you are —”
She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air
, flew
toward Harry
, and tipped over; Mrs. W
easley slid a
bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the
stream of thick, steaming onion soup.
P a g e 
| 92
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Bread, dear?”
“Thanks, Mrs. W
easley
.”
She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of
bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as
www.ztcprep.com

the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back
onto the stove, Mrs. W
easley sat down opposite him.
“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?”
Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he
could not speak.
“He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. W
easley
. “He
was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same
time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?”
His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and
gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.
“I know what you mean,” said Mrs. W
easley
, nodding
wisely
. “Of course he can be charming when he wants
to be, but Arthur
’
s never liked him much. The
Ministry’
s littered with Slughorn’
s old favorites, he
was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had
much time for Arthur — didn’
t seem to think he was
enough of a highflier
. W
ell, that just shows you, even
Slughorn makes mistakes. I don’
t know whether
Ron’
s told you in any of his letters — it’
s only just
happened — but Arthur
’
s been promoted!”
www.ztcprep.com

It could not have been clearer that Mrs. W
easley had
been bursting to say this.
Harry swallowed a lar
ge amount of very hot soup and
thought he could feel his throat blistering. “That’
s
great!” he gasped.
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Y
ou are sweet,” beamed Mrs. W
easley
, possibly
taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news.
“Y
es, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new of
fices
in response to the present situation, and Arthur
’
s
heading the Of
fice for the Detection and Confiscation
of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects.
It’
s a big job, he’
s got ten people reporting to him
now!”
“What exactly — ?”
“W
ell, you see, in all the panic about Y
ou-Know-Who,
odd things have been cropping up for sale
everywhere, things that are supposed to guard
against Y
ou-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. Y
ou
www.ztcprep.com

can imagine the kind of thing — so-called protective
potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber
pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that
actually make your ears fall of
f. … W
ell, in the main
the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus
Fletcher
, who’ve never done an honest day’
s work in
their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened
everybody is, but every now and then something
really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur
confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were
almost certainly planted by a Death Eater
. So you
see, it’
s a very important job, and I tell him it’
s just
silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters
and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.” Mrs. W
easley
ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been
Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark
plugs.
“Is Mr
. W
easley still at work?” Harry asked.
“Y
es, he is. As a matter of fact, he’
s a tiny bit late. …
He said he’d be back around midnight. …”

P a g e

She turned to look at a lar
ge clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a
pile of sheets in the washing
basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at
once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the
name of a family member
, and usually hung on the
W
easleys’ sitting room wall, though its current
position suggested that Mrs. W
easley had taken to
carrying it around the house with her
. Every single
one of its nine hands was now pointing at “mortal
peril.”
“It’
s been like that for a while now
,” said Mrs.
W
easley
, in an unconvincingly casual voice, “ever
since Y
ou-Know-Who came back into the open. I
suppose everybody’
s in mortal danger now
. … I don’
t
think it can be just our family … but I don’
t know
anyone else who’
s got a clock like this, so I can’
t
check. Oh!”
W
ith a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock’
s
face. Mr
. W
easley’
s hand had switched to “traveling.”
www.ztcprep.com

“He’
s coming!”
And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock
on the back door
. Mrs. W
easley jumped up and
hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her
face pressed against the wood she called softly
,
“Arthur
, is that you?”
“Y
es,” came Mr
. W
easley’
s weary voice. “But I would
say that even if I were a Death Eater
, dear
. Ask the
question!”
“Oh, honestly …”
“Molly!”
“All right, all right … What is your dearest ambition?”
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“T
o find out how airplanes stay up.”
Mrs. W
easley nodded and turned the doorknob, but
apparently Mr
. W
easley was holding tight to it on the
other side, because the door remained firmly shut.
“Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first!”
“Arthur
, really
, this is just silly
. …”
www.ztcprep.com

“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone
together?”
Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell
that Mrs. W
easley had turned bright red; he himself
felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and
hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as
he could against the bowl.
“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. W
easley
into the crack at the edge of the door
.
“Correct,” said Mr
. W
easley
. “Now you can let me in.”
Mrs. W
easley opened the door to reveal her husband,
a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn-
rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling
cloak.
“I still don’
t see why we have to go through that every
time you come home,” said Mrs. W
easley
, still pink in
the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak.
“I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer
out of you before impersonating you!”
“I know
, dear
, but it’
s Ministry procedure, and I have

Mr

easley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.
“Harry! W

t expect you until morning!”
They shook hands, and Mr
. W
easley dropped into the
chair beside Harry as Mrs. W
easley set a bowl of soup
in front of him too.
“Thanks, Molly

“Of course I am!” said Mr

. “The boys

“So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?”
“No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in
Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law
Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we
got there. …”
Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.

“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. W
easley at once. “I’ve got Fred and
Geor
ge’
s room all ready for you, you’ll
have it to yourself.”
“Why
, where are they?”
“Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley
, sleeping in the little flat
over their joke shop as they’re so busy
,” said Mrs.
W
easley
. “I must say
, I didn’

they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business!

Come on, dear
, your trunk’
s already up there.”
“ ’Night, Mr
. W
easley
,” said Harry
, pushing back his
chair
. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and
slunk out of the room.
“G’night, Harry
,” said Mr
. W
easley
.
Harry saw Mrs. W
easley glance at the clock in the
washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands
were once again at “mortal peril.”
Fred and Geor
ge’
s bedroom was on the second floor
.
Mrs. W
easley pointed her wand at a lamp on the
bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room
in a pleasant golden glow
. Though a lar
ge vase of
flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the
small window
, their perfume could not disguise the
lingering smell of what Harry thought was
gunpowder
. A considerable amount of floor space was
devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed
cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry’
s school
trunk. The room looked as though it was being used
as a temporary warehouse.

Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top
of a lar

night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds.
There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He
groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-
orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking
Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was
instantly asleep.
Seconds later
, or so it seemed to Harry
, he was
awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the
door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the
rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling
sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes.
Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly
for his glasses with the other

“W

“W

t know you were here already!” said a loud
and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the
top of the head.
“Ron, don’
t hit him!” said a girl’
s voice reproachfully
.
Harry’
s hand found his glasses and he shoved them
on, though the light was so bright he could hardly see
anyway
. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of
him for a moment; he blinked and Ron W
easley came
into focus, grinning down at him.
“All right?”
“Never been better
,” said Harry
, rubbing the top of his
head and slumping back onto his pillows. “Y
ou?”
“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and
sitting on it. “When did you get here? Mum’
s only just
told us!”
“About one o’clock this morning.”

“W
ere the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?”
“Same as usual,” said Harry
, as Hermione perched
www.ztcprep.com

herself on the edge of his bed, “they didn’
t talk to me
much, but I like it better that way
. How’re you,
Hermione?”
“Oh, I’m fine,” said Hermione, who was scrutinizing
Harry as though he was sickening for something. He
thought he knew what was behind this, and as he
had no wish to discuss Sirius’
s death or any other
miserable subject at the moment, he said, “What’
s the
time? Have I missed breakfast?”
“Don’
t worry about that, Mum’
s bringing you up a
tray; she reckons you look underfed,” said Ron,
rolling his eyes. “So, what’
s been going on?”
“Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and
uncle’
s, haven’
t I?”
“Come of
f it!” said Ron. “Y
ou’ve been of
f with
Dumbledore!”
“It wasn’
t that exciting. He just wanted me to help
him persuade this old teacher to come out of
retirement. His name’
s Horace Slughorn.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking disappointed. “W
e thought —”
www.ztcprep.com

Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron
changed tack at top speed.
“— we thought it’d be something like that.”
“Y

, amused.

“Y
eah … yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we
need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher
,
don’
t we? So, er
, what’
s he like?”
“He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head
of Slytherin,” said Harry
. “Something wrong,
Hermione?”
She was watching him as though expecting strange
symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment.
She rearranged her features hastily in an
unconvincing smile.
“No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like
he’ll be a good teacher?”
“Dunno,” said Harry
. “He can’
t be worse than
Umbridge, can he?”
www.ztcprep.com

“I know someone who’
s worse than Umbridge,” said a
voice from the doorway
. Ron’
s younger sister slouched
into the room, looking irritable. “Hi, Harry
.”
“What’
s up with you?” Ron asked.
“It’
s 
her
, 
” said Ginny
, plonking herself down on
Harry’
s bed. “She’
s driving me mad.”
“What’
s she done now?” asked Hermione
sympathetically
.
“It’
s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was
about three!”
“I know
,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She’
s so
full of herself.”
Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about
Mrs. W

saying angrily
, “Can’

f her for five seconds?”
“Oh, that’
s right, defend her
,” snapped Ginny
. “W
e all
know you can’

This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’

mother
. Starting to feel that he was missing
something, Harry said, “Who are you — ?”
But his question was answered before he could finish
it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry
instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so
hard that Hermione and Ginny slid of
f the bed onto
the floor
.
A young woman was standing in the doorway
, a
woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room
seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall
and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to
emanate a faint, silvery glow
. T
o complete this vision
of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden
breakfast tray
.
“ ’Arry
,” she said in a throaty voice. “Eet ’as been too
long!”
As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs.
W
easley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake,
looking rather cross.
“There was no need to bring up the tray
, I was just
www.ztcprep.com

about to do it myself!”
“Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour
, setting the
tray across Harry’
s knees and then swooping to kiss
him on each cheek: He felt the places where her
mouth had touched him burn. “I ’ave been longing to
see ’im. Y
ou remember my seester
, Gabrielle? She
P a g e

never stops talking about ’Arry Potter
. She will be delighted to see you
again.”
“Oh … is she here too?” Harry croaked.
“No, no, silly boy
,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I
mean next summer
, when we — but do you not
know?”
Her great blue eyes widened and she looked
reproachfully at Mrs. W
easley
, who said, “W
e hadn’
t
got around to telling him yet.”
Fleur turned back to Harry
, swinging her silvery sheet
of hair so that it whipped Mrs. W
easley across the
face.
“Bill and I are going to be married!”
www.ztcprep.com

“Oh,” said Harry blankly
. He could not help noticing
how Mrs. W
easley
, Hermione, and Ginny were all
determinedly avoiding one another
’
s gaze. “W
ow
. Er
— congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard,
and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my
Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get
to know ’is family properly
. I was so pleased to ’ear
you would be coming — zere isn’
t much to do ’ere,
unless you like cooking and chickens! W

your breakfast, ’Arry!”
W

float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind
her
.
Mrs. W
easley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!”
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Mum hates her
,” said Ginny quietly
.
“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. W
easley in a cross
www.ztcprep.com

whisper
. “I just think they’ve hurried into this
engagement, that’
s all!”
“They’ve known each other a year
,” said Ron, who
looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed
door
.
“W
ell, that’
s not very long! I know why it’
s happened,
of course. It’
s all this uncertainty with Y
ou-Know-Who
coming back, people think they might be dead
tomorrow
, so they’re rushing all sorts of decisions
they’d normally take time over
. It was the same last
time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and
center —”
“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly
.
“Y
es, well, your father and I were made for each other
,
what was the point in waiting?” said Mrs. W
easley
.
“Whereas Bill and Fleur … well … what have they
really got in common? He’
s a hardworking, down-to-
earth sort of person, whereas she’
s —”
“A cow
,” said Ginny
, nodding. “But Bill’
s not that
down-to-earth. He’
s a Curse-Breaker
, isn’
t he, he
www.ztcprep.com

likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour
. … I expect
that’
s why he’
s gone for Phlegm.”
“Stop calling her that, Ginny
,” said Mrs. W
easley
sharply
, as Harry and Hermione laughed. “W
ell, I’d
better get on. … Eat your eggs while they’re warm,
Harry
.”
Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed
slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head
P a g e

experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water
.
“Don’
t you get used to her if she’
s staying in the same
house?” Harry asked.
“W
ell, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you
unexpectedly
, like then …”
“It’
s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously
, striding away
from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face
him with her arms folded once she had reached the
wall.
“Y
ou don’
t really want her around forever?” Ginny
www.ztcprep.com

asked Ron incredulously
. When he merely shrugged,
she said, “W
ell, Mum’
s going to put a stop to it if she
can, I bet you anything.”
“How’
s she going to manage that?” asked Harry
.
“She keeps trying to get T
onks round for dinner
. I
think she’
s hoping Bill will fall for T
onks instead. I
hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family
.”
“Y
eah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically
. “Listen,
no bloke in his right mind’
s going to fancy T
onks
when Fleur
’
s around. I mean, T
onks is okay-looking
when she isn’
t doing stupid things to her hair and her
nose, but —”
“She’
s a damn sight nicer than 
Phlegm, 
’
’ said Ginny
“And she’
s more intelligent, she’
s an Auror!” said
Hermione from the corner
.
“Fleur
’
s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the
T
riwizard T
ournament,” said Harry
.
P a g e

“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly
.
www.ztcprep.com

“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry
,’ do
you?” asked Ginny scornfully
.
“No,” said Harry
, wishing he hadn’
t spoken, “I was
just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur —”
“I’d much rather have T
onks in the family
,” said
Ginny
. “At least she’
s a laugh.”
“She hasn’
t been much of a laugh lately
,” said Ron.
“Every time I’ve seen her she’
s looked more like
Moaning Myrtle.”
“That’
s not fair
,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’
t
got over what happened … you know … I mean, he
was her cousin!”
Harry’
s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He
picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs
into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join
in this part of the conversation.
“T
onks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron.
“Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that
their families never met —”
“That’
s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it
www.ztcprep.com

was her fault he died!”
“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry
, in
spite of himself.
“W
ell, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’
t
she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her
of
f, Bellatrix couldn’
t have killed Sirius.”
“That’
s stupid,” said Ron.
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“It’
s survivor
’
s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’
s tried to talk her
round, but she’
s still really down.
She’
s actually having trouble with her
Metamorphosing!”
“W
ith her — ?”
“She can’
t change her appearance like she used to,”
explained Hermione. “I think her powers must have
been af
fected by shock, or something.”
“I didn’
t know that could happen,” said Harry
.
“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re
really depressed …”
The door opened again and Mrs. W
easley popped her
www.ztcprep.com

head in. “Ginny
,” she whispered, “come downstairs
and help me with the lunch.”
“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny
, outraged.
“Now!” said Mrs. W
easley
, and withdrew
.
“She only wants me there so she doesn’
t have to be
alone with Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly
. She swung
her long red hair around in a very good imitation of
Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms
held aloft like a ballerina.
“Y
ou lot had better come down quickly too,” she said
as she left.
Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat
more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and
Geor
ge’
s boxes, though every now and then she cast
sideways looks at Harry
. Ron, who was now helping
himself to Harry’
s toast, was still gazing dreamily at
the door
.

“What’
s this?” Hermione asked eventually
, holding up what looked like a
small telescope.
www.ztcprep.com

“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and Geor
ge’ve left it
here, it’
s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so
be careful.”
“Y
our mum said the shop’
s going well,” said Harry
.
“Said Fred and Geor
ge have got a real flair for
business.”
“That’
s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking
in the Galleons! I can’
t wait to see the place, we
haven’
t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says
Dad’
s got to be there for extra security and he’
s been
really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.”
“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third-
eldest W
easley brother had fallen out with the rest of
the family
. “Is he talking to your mum and dad
again?”
“Nope,” said Ron.
“But he knows your dad was right all along now
about V
oldemort being back —”
“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to for
give
others for being wrong than being right,” said
www.ztcprep.com

Hermione. “I heard him telling your mum, Ron.”
“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore
would say
,” said Ron.
“He’
s going to be giving me private lessons this year
,”
said Harry conversationally
.
Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.
P a g e

“Y
ou kept that quiet!” said Ron.
“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly
. “He
told me last night in your broom shed.”
“Blimey … private lessons with Dumbledore!” said
Ron, looking impressed. “I wonder why he’
s … ?”
His voice tailed away
. Harry saw him and Hermione
exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork,
his heart beating rather fast considering that all he
was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to
do it. … Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork,
which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his
lap, and said, “I don’
t know exactly why he’
s going to
www.ztcprep.com

be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because
of the prophecy
.”
Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the
impression that both had frozen. He continued, still
speaking to his fork, “Y
ou know
, the one they were
trying to steal at the Ministry
.”
“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione
quickly
. “It got smashed.”
“Although the 
Pr
ophet
 says —” began Ron, but
Hermione said, “Shh!”
“The 
Pr
ophet’
s
 got it right,” said Harry
, looking up at
them both with a great ef
fort: Hermione seemed
frightened and Ron amazed. “That glass ball that
smashed wasn’
t the only record of the prophecy
. I
heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’
s of
fice, he was
the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell
me. From what it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it
looks like I’m the one who’
s got to finish of
f
V
oldemort. … At least, it said neither of us could live
while the other survives.”

The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there
was a loud bang and Hermione
vanished behind a puf
f of black smoke.
“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast
tray slid to the floor with a crash.
Hermione emer
ged, coughing, out of the smoke,
clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly
purple black eye.
“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped.
And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long
spring protruding from the end of the telescope.
“Don’
t worry
,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to
laugh, “Mum’ll fix that, she’
s good at healing minor
injuries —”
“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione
hastily
. “Harry
, oh, Harry …”
She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
“W
e wondered, after we got back from the Ministry …
Obviously
, we didn’
t want to say anything to you, but
www.ztcprep.com

from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy
,
how it was about you and V
oldemort, well, we
thought it might be something like this. … Oh, Harry
…” She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you
scared?”
“Not as much as I was,” said Harry
. “When I first
heard it, I was … but now
, it seems as though I
always knew I’d have to face him in the end. …”
“When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in
person, we thought he might be telling you something

or showing you something to do with the prophecy
,”
said Ron eagerly
. “And we were kind of right, weren’
t
we? He wouldn’
t be giving you lessons if he thought
you were a goner
, wouldn’
t waste his time — he must
think you’ve got a chance!”
“That’
s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll
teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic,
probably … powerful countercurses … anti-jinxes …”
www.ztcprep.com

Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading
through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight;
a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be
dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were
more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere
fact that they were still there on either side of him,
speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking
from him as though he were contaminated or
dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell
them.
“… and evasive enchantments generally
,” concluded
Hermione. “W
ell, at least you know one lesson you’ll
be having this year
, that’
s one more than Ron and
me. I wonder when our O.W
.L. results will come?”
“Can’
t be long now
, it’
s been a month,” said Ron.
“Hang on,” said Harry
, as another part of last night’
s
conversation came back to him. “I think Dumbledore
said our O.W
.L. results would be arriving today!”
“T
oday?” shrieked Hermione. “
T
oday
? But why didn’
t
you — oh my God — you should have said —”

She leapt to her feet.
“I’m going to see whether any owls have come. …”

But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later
, fully dressed and
carrying his empty breakfast tray
, it
was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in
great agitation, while Mrs. W
easley tried to lessen her
resemblance to half a panda.
“It just won’
t budge,” Mrs. W
easley was saying
anxiously
, standing over Hermione with her wand in
her hand and a copy of 
The
 
Healer
’
s Helpmate
 open at
“Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always
worked before, I just can’
t understand it.”
“It’ll be Fred and Geor

making sure it can’
t come of

“But it’

“Y

said Mrs. W

.
“Bill told me ’ow Fred and Geor
ge are very amusing!”
www.ztcprep.com

said Fleur
, smiling serenely
.
“Y
es, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped
Hermione.
She jumped up and started walking round and round
the kitchen, twisting her fingers together
.
“Mrs. W
easley
, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have
arrived this morning?”
“Y
es, dear
, I’d have noticed,” said Mrs. W
easley
patiently
. “But it’
s barely nine, there’
s still plenty of

back —”
“Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the only one
who’
s nervous!” barked Ron. “And when you’ve got
your eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W

“Don’
t, don’
t, don’
t!” said Hermione, flapping her
hands hysterically
. “I know I’ve failed everything!”
“What happens if we fail?” Harry asked the room at
lar
ge, but it was again Hermione who answered.
“W
e discuss our options with our Head of House, I
asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.”
Harry’
s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten
less breakfast.
“At Beauxbatons,” said Fleur complacently
, “we ’ad a
dif
ferent way of doing things. I think eet was better
.
W
e sat our examinations after six years of study
, not
five, and then —”
Fleur
’
s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione
was pointing through the kitchen window
. Three
black specks were clearly visible in the sky
, growing
lar
ger all the time.
“They’re definitely owls,” said Ron hoarsely
, jumping
up to join Hermione at the window
.
“And there are three of them,” said Harry
, hastening
to her other side.
www.ztcprep.com

“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a terrified
whisper
. “Oh no … oh no … oh no …”
P a g e

She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the
elbows.
The owls were flying directly at the Burrow
, three
handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as
they flew lower over the path leading up to the house,
was carrying a lar
ge square envelope.
“Oh 
no
!” squealed Hermione.
Mrs. W
easley squeezed past them and opened the
kitchen window
. One, two, three, the owls soared
through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All
three of them lifted their right legs.
Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him
was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied
it with fumbling fingers. T
o his left, Ron was trying to
detach his own results; to his right, Hermione’
s
hands were shaking so much she was making her
www.ztcprep.com

whole owl tremble.
Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed
to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and
unfolded the parchment inside.

Harry read the parchment through several times, his
breathing becoming easier with each reading. It was
all right: He had always known that he would fail
Divination, and he had had no chance of passing
History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway
through the examination, but he had passed
everything else! He ran his finger down the grades …
he had passed well in T
ransfiguration and Herbology
,
www.ztcprep.com

he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And
best of all, he had achieved “Outstanding” at Defense

He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and
her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted.
“Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who
cares about them?” he said happily to Harry
. “Here —
swap —”
Harry glanced down Ron’
s grades: There were no
“Outstandings” there. …
“Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,”
said Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder

“Hermione?” said Ginny tentatively
, for Hermione still hadn’
t turned
around. “How did you do?”
“I — not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice.
www.ztcprep.com

“Oh, come of
f it,” said Ron, striding over to her and
whipping her results out of her hand. “Y
ep — nine
‘Outstandings’ and one ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at
Defense Against the Dark Arts.” He looked down at
her
, half-amused, half-exasperated. “Y
ou’re actually
disappointed, aren’
t you?”
Hermione shook her head, but Harry laughed.
“W
ell, we’re N.E.W

“Mum, are there any more sausages?”
Harry looked back down at his results. They were as
good as he could have hoped for
. He felt just one tiny
twinge of regret. … This was the end of his ambition
to become an Auror

It was odd, really

, but somehow the idea had taken
hold of him, and he couldn’

Harry remained within the confines of the Burrow’
s
garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his
days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the W
easleys’
orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny;
www.ztcprep.com

Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were
reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating
triple helpings of everything Mrs. W
easley put in front
of him.
It would have been a happy
, peaceful holiday had it
not been for the stories of disappearances, odd
accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily
in the 
Pr
ophet. 
Sometimes Bill and Mr

easley
brought home news before it even reached the paper
.
T
o Mrs. W
easley’
s displeasure, Harry’
s sixteenth
birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings
brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was
looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked
liberally with gray
, his clothes more ragged and
patched than ever
.

“There have been another couple of dementor
attacks,” he announced, as Mrs. W
easley passed him
a lar
ge slice of birthday cake. “And they’ve found Igor

f
’
s body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark
had been set over it — well, frankly
, I’m surprised he
stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death
Eaters; Sirius’
s brother
, Regulus, only managed a few
days as far as I can remember
.”
“Y
es, well,” said Mrs. W
easley
, frowning, “perhaps we
should talk about something dif
f —”
“Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?”
asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur
.
“The man who ran —”
“— the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry
interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in
the pit of his stomach. “He used to give me free ice
creams. What’
s happened to him?”
“Dragged of
f, by the look of his place.”
“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. W
easley pointedly
glared at Bill.
“Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow
. He
was a good man, Florean.”
“T
alking of Diagon Alley

easley
, “looks

like Ollivander

“The wandmaker?” said Ginny
, looking startled.
“That’
s the one. Shop’
s empty
. No sign of a struggle.
No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was
kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the
best, and if the other side have got
him it’
s not so good for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their
letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harry’
s
included a surprise: He had been made Quidditch
Captain.
“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried
Hermione happily
. “Y
ou can use our special bathroom
now and everything!”
“W
ow
, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,”
said Ron, examining the badge with glee. “Harry
, this
is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let me back on

the team, I suppose, ha ha. …”
“W
ell, I don’
t suppose we can put of
f a trip to Diagon
Alley much longer now you’ve got these,” sighed Mrs.
W
easley
, looking down Ron’
s booklist. “W
e’ll go on
Saturday as long as your father doesn’
t have to go
into work again. I’m not going there without him.”
“Mum, d’you honestly think Y
ou-Know-Who’
s going to
be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?”
sniggered Ron.
“Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday
, did they?”
said Mrs. W
easley
, firing up at once. “If you think
security’
s a laughing matter you can stay behind and
I’ll get your things myself —”
“No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and Geor
ge’
s
shop!” said Ron hastily
.
“Then you just buck up your ideas, young man,
before I decide you’re too immature to come with us!”
said Mrs. W
easley angrily
, snatching up her clock, all

nine hands of which were still pointing at “mortal peril,” and balancing it
on top of a pile of just-laundered towels. “And that goes for returning to
Hogwarts as well!”
Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his
mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering
clock into her arms and stormed out of the room.
“Blimey … you can’
t even make a joke round here
anymore. …”
But Ron was careful not to be flippant about
V
oldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned
without any more outbursts from Mrs. W
easley
,
though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who
would be staying at home with Fleur (much to
Hermione and Ginny’
s pleasure), passed a full money
bag across the table to Harry
.
“Where’
s mine?” demanded Ron at once, his eyes
wide.
“That’
s already Harry’
s, idiot,” said Bill. “I got it out of
your vault for you, Harry
, because it’
s taking about
five hours for the public to get to their gold at the
moment, the goblins have tightened security so

much. T

.”
“Thanks, Bill,” said Harry
, pocketing his gold.
“ ’E is always so thoughtful,” purred Fleur adoringly
,
stroking Bill’
s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her
cereal behind Fleur
. Harry choked over his
cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.

It was an overcast, murky day
. One of the special
Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden
once before, was awaiting them in the front yard
when they emer
ged from the house, pulling on their
cloaks.
“It’
s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron
appreciatively
, stretching luxuriously as the car
moved smoothly away from the Burrow
, Bill and Fleur
waving from the kitchen window
. He, Harry
,
Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy
www.ztcprep.com

comfort in the wide backseat.
“Don’
t get used to it, it’
s only because of Harry
,” said
Mr
. W
easley over his shoulder
. He and Mrs. W
easley
were in front with the Ministry driver; the front
passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what
resembled a two-seater sofa. “He’
s been given top-
grade security status. And we’ll be joining up with
additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.”
Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his
shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors.
He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack
and felt that, if that was good enough for
Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the
Ministry
, though now he came to think of it, he was
not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak.
“Here you are, then,” said the driver
, a surprisingly
short while later
, speaking for the first time as he
slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside
the Leaky Cauldron. “I’m to wait for you, any idea
how long you’ll be?”
www.ztcprep.com

“A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr
. W
easley
. “Ah,
good, he’
s here!”
P a g e 
| 121
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
Harry imitated Mr
. W
easley and peered through the
window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting
outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-
bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts
gamekeeper
, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming
at the sight of Harry’
s face and oblivious to the
startled stares of passing Muggles.
“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-
crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of
the car
. “Buckbeak — W
itherwings, I mean — yeh
should see him, Harry
, he’
s so happy ter be back in
the open air —”
“Glad he’
s pleased,” said Harry
, grinning as he
massaged his ribs. “W
e didn’
t know ‘security’ meant
you!”
“I know
, jus’ like old times, innit? See, the Ministry
www.ztcprep.com

wanted ter send a bunch o’ Aurors, but Dumbledore
said I’d do,” said Hagrid proudly
, throwing out his
chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. “Let’
s
get goin’ then — after yeh, Molly
, Arthur —”
The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry’
s
memory
, completely empty
. Only T
om the landlord,
wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He
looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he
could speak, Hagrid said importantly
, “Jus’ passin’
through today
, T
om, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts
business, yeh know
.”
T
om nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses;
Harry
, Hermione, Hagrid, and the W
easleys walked
through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard
at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised
his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the
wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a
P a g e 
| 122

winding cobbled street. They stepped through the
www.ztcprep.com

entrance and paused, looking around.
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering
window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients,
and cauldrons were lost to view
, hidden behind the
lar
ge Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted
over them. Most of these somber purple posters
carried blown-up versions of the security advice on
the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over
the summer
, but others bore moving black-and-white
photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the
loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front
of the nearest apothecary
. A few windows were
boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescue’
s Ice
Cream Parlor
. On the other hand, a number of
shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street.
The nearest one, which had been erected outside
Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning,
had a cardboard sign pinned to its front:
AMULETS
Ef
fective Against W
erewolves, Dementors, and Inferi
www.ztcprep.com

A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of
silver symbols on chains at passersby
.
“One for your little girl, madam?” he called at Mrs.
W
easley as they passed, leering at Ginny
. “Protect her
pretty neck?”
“If I were on duty …” said Mr
. W
easley
, glaring angrily
at the amulet seller
.
“Y
es, but don’
t go arresting anyone now
, dear
, we’re
in a hurry
,” said Mrs. W
easley
, nervously consulting a
list. “I think we’d better do Madam Malkin’
s first,
Hermione wants new dress robes, and Ron’
s showing
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
much too much ankle in his school robes, and you
must need new ones too, Harry
, you’ve grown so
much — come on, everyone —”
“Molly
, it doesn’
t make sense for all of us to go to
Madam Malkin’
s,” said Mr
. W
easley
. “Why don’
t those
three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and
Blotts and get everyone’
s schoolbooks?”
www.ztcprep.com

“I don’
t know
,” said Mrs. W
easley anxiously
, clearly
torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly
and the wish to stick together in a pack. “Hagrid, do
you think — ?”
“Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly
,” said Hagrid
soothingly
, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin
lid. Mrs. W
easley did not look entirely convinced, but
allowed the separation, scurrying of
f toward Flourish
and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry
,
Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set of
f for Madam
Malkin’
s.
Harry noticed that many of the people who passed
them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs.
W
easley
, and that nobody was stopping to talk
anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own
tightly knit groups, moving intently about their
business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone.
“Migh’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,”
said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkin’
s and
bending down to peer through the window
. “I’ll stand
www.ztcprep.com

guard outside, all right?”
So Harry
, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop
together
. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty
, but
no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than
they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack
of dress robes in spangled green and blue.
P a g e 
| 124
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“… not a child, in case you haven’
t noticed, Mother
. I am perfectly capable
of doing my shopping 
alone. 
”
There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry
recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner
, said,
“Now
, dear
, your mother
’
s quite right, none of us is
supposed to go wandering around on our own
anymore, it’
s nothing to do with being a child —”
“W
atch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!”
A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-
blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a
handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with
pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He
strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a
www.ztcprep.com

few moments before he noticed Harry
, Ron, and
Hermione reflected over his shoulder
. His light gray
eyes narrowed.
“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother
, a
Mudblood just walked in,” said Draco Malfoy
.
“I don’
t think there’
s any need for language like that!”
said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the
clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand.
“And I don’
t want wands drawn in my shop either!”
she added hastily
, for a glance toward the door had
shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with
their wands out and pointing at Malfoy
. Hermione,
who was standing slightly behind them, whispered,
“No, don’
t, honestly
, it’
s not worth it. …”
“Y
eah, like you’d dare do magic out of school,”
sneered Malfoy
. “Who blacked your eye, Granger? I
want to send them flowers.”
P a g e 
| 125
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“That’
s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply
,
www.ztcprep.com

looking over her shoulder for support. “Madam —
please —”
Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes
rack.
“Put those away
,” she said coldly to Harry and Ron.
“If you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is
the last thing you ever do.”
“Really?” said Harry
, taking a step forward and gazing
into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor
,
still resembled her sister
’
s. He was as tall as she was
now
. “Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in,
are you?”
Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.
“Really
, you shouldn’
t accuse — dangerous thing to
say — wands away
, please!”
But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy
smiled unpleasantly
.
“I see that being Dumbledore’
s favorite has given you
a false sense of security
, Harry Potter
. But
Dumbledore won’
t always be there to protect you.”
www.ztcprep.com

Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. “W
ow …
look at that … he’
s not here now! So why not have a
go? They might be able to find you a double cell in
Azkaban with your loser of a husband!”
Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry
, but
stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly
.
“Don’
t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!”
Malfoy snarled.
P a g e 
| 126
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“It’
s all right, Draco,” said Narcissa, restraining him with her thin white
fingers upon his shoulder
. “I
expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I
am reunited with Lucius.”
Harry raised his wand higher
.
“Harry
, no!” moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and
attempting to push it down by his side. “Think. …
Y
ou mustn’
t. … Y
ou’ll be in such trouble. …”
Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot,
then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was
happening in the hope that it wouldn’
t. She bent
www.ztcprep.com

toward Malfoy
, who was still glaring at Harry
.
“I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more,
dear
, let me just —”
“Ouch!” bellowed Malfoy
, slapping her hand away
.
“W
atch where you’re putting your pins, woman!
Mother — I don’
t think I want these anymore —”
He pulled the robes over his head and threw them
onto the floor at Madam Malkin’
s feet.
“Y
ou’re right, Draco,” said Narcissa, with a
contemptuous glance at Hermione, “now I know the
kind of scum that shops here. … W
e’ll do better at
T
wilfitt and T
atting’
s.”
And with that, the pair of them strode out of the
shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could
into Ron on the way out.
“W
ell, 
r
eally
!” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the
fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them
like a vacuum cleaner
, so that it removed all the dust.
