“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’
s what you’re
suggesting!” said the Prime Minister
hotly
. “He’
s highly ef
ficient, gets through twice the
work the rest of them —”
“That’
s because he’
s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour
,
without a flicker of a smile. “A highly trained Auror
,
who has been assigned to you for your protection.”
“Now
, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister
.
“Y
ou can’
t just put your people into my of
fice, I decide
who works for me —”
“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said
Scrimgeour coldly
.
“I am — that’
s to say
, I was —”
“Then there’
s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour
.
“I … well, as long as Shacklebolt’
s work continues to
be … er … excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely
,
but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.
“Now
, about Herbert Chorley
, your Junior Minister
,”
he continued. “The one who has been entertaining the
public by impersonating a duck.”
“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister
.

“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed
Imperius Curse,” said Scrimgeour
. “It’
s addled his
brains, but he could still be dangerous.”
“He’
s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly
.
“Surely a bit of a rest … Maybe go easy on the drink
…”

“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’
s Hospital for
Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as
we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of
them,” said Scrimgeour
. “I think it best that we
remove him from Muggle society for a while.”
“I … well … He’ll be all right, won’
t he?” said the
Prime Minister anxiously
.
Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back
toward the fireplace.
“W
ell, that’
s really all I had to say
. I will keep you
posted of developments, Prime Minister — or
, at least,
I shall probably be too busy to come personally
, in
www.ztcprep.com

which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented
to stay on in an advisory capacity
.”
Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he
merely looked as though he had a toothache.
Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for
the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The
Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them
for a moment, then the words he had fought to
suppress all evening burst from him at last.
“But for heaven’
s sake — you’re 
wizar
ds
! Y
ou can do
magic
! Surely you can sort out — well — 
anything
!”
Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged
an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did
manage a smile this time as he said kindly
, “The
trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime
Minister
.”
And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the
other into the bright green fire and vanished.

SPINNER’S END
Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed
against the Prime Minister
’
s windows drifted over a
dirty river that wound between over
grown, rubbish-
strewn banks. An immense chimney
, relic of a
disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There
was no sound apart from the whisper of the black
water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that
had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some
old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass.
But then, with a very faint 
pop, 
a slim, hooded figure
appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river
. The
fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new
phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings
www.ztcprep.com

for a few moments, then set of
f with light, quick
strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.
W
ith a second and louder 
pop, 
another hooded figure
materialized.
“W
ait!”

The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the
under
growth. It leapt from its hiding place
and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a
yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead.
The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.
“Just a fox,” said a woman’
s voice dismissively from
under the hood. “I thought perhaps an Auror —
Cissy
, wait!”
But her quarry
, who had paused and looked back at
the flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank
the fox had just fallen down.
“Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me —”
The second woman caught the first and seized her
arm, but the other wrenched it away
.
www.ztcprep.com

“Go back, Bella!”
“Y
ou must listen to me!”
“I’ve listened already
. I’ve made my decision. Leave me
alone!”
The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the
bank, where a line of old railings separated the river
from a narrow
, cobbled street. The other woman,
Bella, followed at once. Side by side they stood
looking across the road at the rows and rows of
dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and
blind in the darkness.
“He lives here?” asked Bella in a voice of contempt.
“
Her
e
? In this Muggle dunghill? W
e must be the first
of our kind ever to set foot —”
P a g e

But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped
through a gap in the rusty railings and was already
hurrying across the road.
“Cissy
, 
wait
!”
www.ztcprep.com

Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw
Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses
into a second, almost identical street. Some of the
streetlamps were broken; the two women were
running between patches of light and deep darkness.
The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she
turned another corner
, this time succeeding in
catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so
that they faced each other
.
“Cissy
, you must not do this, you can’
t trust him —”
“The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn’
t he?”
“The Dark Lord is … I believe … mistaken,” Bella
panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her
hood as she looked around to check that they were
indeed alone. “In any case, we were told not to speak
of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark
Lord’
s —”
“Let go, Bella!” snarled Narcissa, and she drew a
wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly
in the other
’
s face. Bella merely laughed.
www.ztcprep.com

“Cissy
, your own sister? Y
ou wouldn’
t —”
“There is nothing I wouldn’
t do anymore!” Narcissa
breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she
brought down the wand like a knife, there was
another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister
’
s arm
as though burned.

“
Nar
cissa
!”
But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand,
her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now
,
as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of
brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street
named Spinner
’
s End, over which the towering mill
chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory
finger
. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she
passed boarded and broken windows, until she
reached the very last house, where a dim light
glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs
room.
www.ztcprep.com

She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing
under her breath, had caught up. T
ogether they stood
waiting, panting slightly
, breathing in the smell of the
dirty river that was carried to them on the night
breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement
behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a
man could be seen looking out at them, a man with
long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow
face and black eyes.
Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that
she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde
hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a
drowned person.
“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little
wider
, so that the light fell upon her and her sister
too. “What a pleasant surprise!”
“Severus,” she said in a strained whisper
. “May I
speak to you? It’
s ur
gent.”
“But of course.”

He stood back to allow her to pass him into the
house. Her still-hooded sister followed without
invitation.
“Snape,” she said curtly as she passed him.
“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a
slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a
snap behind them.
They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room,
which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls
were completely covered in books, most of them
bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare
sofa, an old armchair
, and a rickety table stood
grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a
candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place
had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually
inhabited.
Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw of
f
her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her
white and trembling hands clasped in her lap.

Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly
. Dark as her
sister was fair
, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong
jaw
, she did not take her gaze from Snape as she
moved to stand behind Narcissa.
“So, what can I do for you?” Snape asked, settling
himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters.
“W
e … we are alone, aren’
t we?” Narcissa asked
quietly
.
“Y
es, of course. W
ell, W
ormtail’
s here, but we’re not
counting vermin, are we?”
He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him
and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a
P a g e

narrow staircase upon which a small man stood
frozen.
“As you have clearly realized, W
ormtail, we have
guests,” said Snape lazily
.
The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps
and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes,
